# Two-finger pan and zoom demo with three.js and React

Live demo at https://grantcuster.github.io/touchZoomAndPan

A minimal-ish demo where I work through how to do two-finger pan and zoom with pointerEvents using three.js and in React. The pan and zoom works well but the code got messier than I intended and I'll probably take another run at it again someday soon.

# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
